# AssessmentBuddy

I created this project as a testbed for learning [Grails](https://grails.org/).

Eventually this is intended to be a web app for collecting and analyzing assessment data.

This is a work in progress.  Don't expect it to do anything useful.  Also, don't expect it to be a good example of how a Grails app should be written.
